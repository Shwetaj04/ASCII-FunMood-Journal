# ASCII-FunMood-Journal
Transform pictures into ASCII art, capture your mood, and get a reflection plus a memeâ€”all in one place!

#Inspiration
Journaling is an art, which people use to express their daily emotional snapshot. My goal was to bring a little more life to journaling by adding a visually engaging and mood-lifting ASCII converter, along with a mood reflection zone with a touch of humour.

#What it does
-Conversion of any picture into ASCII art
-Mood logging with cheering reflection
-Meme display based on mood
#How I built it
-Languages & Libraries: Python, PIL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
-Core Logic:
  -Converts images into ASCII art using pixel brightness mapping
  -Maps user's mood to soothing reflective sentences
  -Displays a funny meme based on mood
